-Added Mesh struct to store load data of models for use in collision, etc.


README v1.0 Jan 24, 2016
This is a personal project that I worked on during my time at Full Sail University. 
This was a project to explore current rendering techniques and learn more about GPU processing.
I was under a time crunch of just one month working on something I've never done before.  

WSADQE - Movement
TAB - Toggle Light Heatmap
R - Randomize Light Positions
L - Toggle Light Sphere Debug Lines

KNOWN ISSUES:
  The Refraction is created with hard-coded MACROs rather than sampling from a texture
  Water and glass don't have any Reflection.
  Refraction isn't using an alpha mask so you can refract things that are in front of the refracter object.
  Screen doesn't clear so if you leave the scene bounds, there will be artifacts.
  File heirarchy doesn't exist anymore.
  
DISCLAIMER:
I didn't have much time to work on this initially.  I am going through and cleaning up some of the code when I have time.
My intentions were to use this as a learning experience only but many people have asked to see the solution to learn for themselves.
My code would have been stricter on standards, more well documented and generally cleaner if I was aware that another would use this.
When learning something new, I commented a good amount such as inside the Compute Shader. Other times were much less documented.
